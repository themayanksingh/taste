# Taste Pipeline

This directory now holds only stable pipeline inputs and the current generated
skill:

```text
pipeline/taste/taste-skill/SKILL.md         # current reusable taste skill
```

The production pipeline lives in the Vercel web app under `apps/web` and writes
per-run artifacts to Vercel Blob:

```text
runs/{runId}/01-corpus/images.jsonl
runs/{runId}/02-image-notes/raw/{imageId}/{model}.md
runs/{runId}/02-image-notes/synthesized/{imageId}.md
runs/{runId}/03-rule-set/chunks/{chunkId}-rules.md
runs/{runId}/03-rule-set/merges/{mergeId}-rules.md
runs/{runId}/03-rule-set/rule-set.md
runs/{runId}/04-skill/SKILL.md
```

## Current Production Process

1. Upload up to 20 reference images.
2. Index uploaded images, dedupe exact duplicates, and assign stable image ids.
3. For each active image, run the configured raw analysis models in parallel.
4. As soon as an image's raw analyses finish, use `SYNTHESIS_MODEL` to create
   its canonical note. The default is `openai/gpt-5.5`.
   - Anonymize raw analysis before fusion. Strip artifact frontmatter and omit
     model names from section titles.
   - Redact known source model IDs from carried-forward error text. This keeps
     the fusion model from favoring its own analysis.
   - Keep source model metadata only in stored artifact metadata for audit and
     debugging.
5. Split synthesized notes into rule chunks.
6. If there are too many chunks for one clean merge, reduce them through
   intermediate merge layers using `RULE_MERGE_FAN_IN`.
7. Generate the final rule set.
8. Generate the final `SKILL.md`.

## Tuning

The app defaults are speed-first with bounded safety:

```text
MAX_IMAGES_PER_RUN=20
ANALYSIS_MODELS=openai/gpt-5.5,anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
SYNTHESIS_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.5
RULE_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.5
SKILL_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.5
ANALYZE_IMAGE_CONCURRENCY=8
SYNTHESIZE_NOTE_CONCURRENCY=8
RULE_CHUNK_SIZE=10
RULE_MERGE_FAN_IN=6
```

High-volume stages retry transient gateway failures and create explicit
soft-failure artifacts when a single image/model path cannot recover. The run
should continue whenever enough evidence remains to produce a final skill.

## Production E2E

Run the production reference-image flow from the repo root:

```bash
set -a
. apps/web/.env.local
set +a
npm run e2e:prod --workspace @taste/web
```

By default this uses `https://taste.jaytel.com` and local, gitignored images in
`reference-images/`. Set `TASTE_REFERENCE_DIR` to point at another private
image corpus.

# AI Pipeline Package

Shared prompt and generation package for the web app backend.

## Purpose

The web app calls stable functions here for AI-backed pipeline steps instead of putting model calls and prompt assembly directly in API routes.

This package keeps the command-line pipeline behavior. It uses the Vercel AI
SDK with pluggable providers.

## Planned shape

```text
packages/ai/
  src/
    config.ts       # model defaults and output-token defaults
    prompts.ts      # analysis/synthesis/rule/skill prompts
    providers.ts    # provider-routed calls through AI SDK
    pipeline.ts     # step functions used by the web runner
    chunking.ts     # deterministic note chunking
```

Default analysis models:

```text
openai/gpt-5.5
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

The package exposes generation functions for raw image analysis, synthesized image notes, rule chunks, the final rule set, and the final skill.

The synthesis prompt combines source-neutral analysis inputs. It strips raw
artifact frontmatter, removes model names from analysis headings, and redacts
known source model IDs from analysis text. The fusion model cannot see which
model produced each analysis.

Supported credential modes for local tooling and backend callers:

```text
direct           # separate OpenAI and Anthropic keys; intended local default
openai           # one OpenAI key, OpenAI models only
anthropic        # one Anthropic key, Anthropic models only
openrouter       # one OpenRouter key for both OpenAI and Anthropic model IDs
vercel_gateway   # one Vercel AI Gateway key through AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY
```

The hosted web app intentionally exposes OpenRouter OAuth only. Keep direct
provider-key entry out of `apps/web`; reuse this package for local CLI or agent
workflows that need individual OpenAI/Anthropic keys.

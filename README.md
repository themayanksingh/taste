# Taste

Taste turns a set of reference images into a reusable `SKILL.md`.

- Hosted demo: <https://taste.jaytel.com>
- Try a taste skill: [`pipeline/taste/taste-skill/SKILL.md`](pipeline/taste/taste-skill/SKILL.md)

## Repo Shape

```text
apps/web/          hosted frontend demo and API worker implementation
packages/ai/       reusable prompt, provider, chunking, and generation package
scripts/           local pipeline runner for humans and agents
reference-images/  ignored local drop folder for your own JPG/PNG/WebP inputs
pipeline/taste/    Jaytel's example generated taste skill and pipeline notes
docs/              README images and examples
```

The web app is a demo of the broader pipeline. The local pipeline is the easiest
way to use this repo privately: it writes artifacts to `.taste/runs/...` and
does not need Postgres, Vercel Blob, Cron, or hosted auth.

## Quick Start: Local Pipeline

Use this path if you want to create a taste skill from your own images.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set the direct provider keys in `.env.local`:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

Put JPG, PNG, or WebP reference images in `reference-images/`, then run:

```bash
npm run taste
```

The final skill is written to:

```text
.taste/runs/<run-id>/SKILL.md
.taste/runs/<run-id>/04-skill/SKILL.md
```

You can use one gateway key instead of the two direct keys. Set either
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. Vercel's AI Gateway uses
`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. By default, it routes plain AI SDK model strings through
the Gateway.

Run against a different folder:

```bash
npm run taste -- ./path/to/images
```

Useful options:

```bash
npm run taste -- ./images --out ./my-skill-run
npm run taste -- ./images --skill-name my-taste
npm run taste -- ./images --provider openrouter
npm run taste -- ./images --model openai/gpt-5.5
```

## Comparison

We ran a small frontend design comparison with three agents: one base model
with no skill, one using Anthropic's `frontend-design` skill, and one using the
generated Taste skill from `pipeline/taste/taste-skill/SKILL.md`. Each agent was
given the same prompt within each test and asked to produce a standalone HTML
file.

### Test 01: Opus 4.7

Prompt: `Design a dashboard. Build in an HTML file. Ask no questions.`

### Test 02: Opus 4.7

Prompt: `Design a chat interface. Build in an HTML file. Ask no questions.`

### Test 03: GPT-5.5

Prompt: `Design a chat interface. Build in an HTML file. Ask no questions.`

## How It Works

### 1. Curate References

Provide a tight set of reference images. High-resolution images help, and
close-up crops are often better than full screens because they make the visual
details easier to read.

The goal is not random inspiration. The useful signals are repeated examples of
layout, spacing, color, type, texture, composition, density, and hierarchy.

### 2. Index the Corpus

The pipeline indexes every uploaded image, removes exact duplicates, and assigns
stable image ids. The current production limit is 20 images per run.

Artifacts start here:

```text
runs/{runId}/01-corpus/images.jsonl
```

### 3. Analyze Each Image

Each image is read independently by the configured vision models. The default
two-key pipeline uses:

```text
openai/gpt-5.5
anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

The prompts tell the models to ignore what the app does and focus only on
visual evidence: layout, spacing, color, type, texture, rhythm, density, and
hierarchy.

Raw notes are stored like this:

```text
runs/{runId}/02-image-notes/raw/{imageId}/{model}.md
```

### 4. Fuse and Chunk

When an image's raw analyses finish, the synthesis model combines them into one
canonical note. The pipeline anonymizes the inputs first. The model sees
source-neutral analyses instead of provider names.

Then the synthesized notes are grouped into chunks. Each chunk becomes a small
rule synthesis. Larger runs are reduced through merge layers before producing
one final Markdown rule set.

```text
runs/{runId}/02-image-notes/synthesized/{imageId}.md
runs/{runId}/03-rule-set/chunks/{chunkId}-rules.md
runs/{runId}/03-rule-set/merges/{mergeId}-rules.md
runs/{runId}/03-rule-set/rule-set.md
```

### 5. Write the Skill

The skill writer turns the final rule set into concrete instructions. It keeps
specific visual constraints and avoids vague aesthetic labels.

Instead of saying "make it premium and tasteful," the skill says things like:

- Use neutral sans-serif typography.
- Keep accent color localized.
- Use soft shadows and minimal borders.
- Avoid beige luxury-commerce defaults.

The final artifact is:

```text
runs/{runId}/04-skill/SKILL.md
```

The current checked-in example skill is Jaytel's skill:
`pipeline/taste/taste-skill/SKILL.md`.

## Production Shape

The hosted app stores workflow state in Postgres and writes run artifacts to
private Vercel Blob storage.

```text
browser uploads -> Next API routes -> Postgres workflow jobs
                                     -> OpenRouter OAuth session
                                     -> private Vercel Blob artifacts
```

`apps/web/src/workflow/runner.ts` owns the durable job flow. `/api/jobs/drain`
claims bounded batches with database leases, and Vercel Cron can re-enter the
drain so interrupted functions resume.

## Verification

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run e2e:prod
```

The production E2E script requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`,
`INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, and `TASTE_E2E_COOKIE` from a signed-in OpenRouter
session. Put local test images in `reference-images/`, or set
`TASTE_REFERENCE_DIR`. Git ignores the reference images by design.
